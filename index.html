        <p>I am currently a 21 year old Senior majoring in aviation administration with a minor in flight dispatch. I work as a semi truck driver on the weekends for an ice supplier in Woodridge. I do local deliveries to gas stations, grocery stores, food processors and even O'hare airport. For my family, I have my mom and my dad, along with my older sister who currently lives in Washington DC.</p>
